## Features Implemented

## Testing PWA Features

### Local Testing
1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Serve with HTTPS (required for PWA)
3. Open Chrome DevTools > Application > Service Workers
4. Test offline mode by checking "Offline" in DevTools

### Lighthouse Audit
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Lighthouse tab
3. Select "Progressive Web App" category
4. Run audit to check PWA compliance

## Customization

### Update App Colors
Edit `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "theme_color": "#0ea5e9",
  "background_color": "#ffffff"
}
```

### Change App Name
Update in `public/manifest.json` and `index.html`

### Add More Shortcuts
Edit the `shortcuts` array in `manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "New Feature",
  "url": "/feature",
  "icons": [{ "src": "/icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192" }]
}
```

### Modify Caching Strategy
Edit `public/sw.js` to change what gets cached:
```javascript
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  // Add more URLs to cache
];
```

## Deployment Requirements

### HTTPS Required
- PWA requires HTTPS (except localhost)
- Lovable automatically provides HTTPS
- Custom domains must have SSL certificate

### Headers (Optional)
For better PWA experience, consider adding these headers:
```
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Monitoring

### Service Worker Status
Check service worker status in browser:
- Chrome: `chrome://serviceworker-internals/`
- Firefox: `about:serviceworkers`
- Safari: Develop > Service Workers

### Cache Storage
View cached resources:
- Chrome DevTools > Application > Cache Storage
- See what's cached and clear if needed

## Best Practices

1. **Update Strategy**: Always test updates before deploying
2. **Cache Size**: Keep cached resources under 50MB
3. **Offline UX**: Provide clear offline indicators
4. **Update Prompts**: Don't force updates, let users choose
5. **Icons**: Use high-quality icons for all sizes

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Install
- Check HTTPS is enabled
- Verify manifest.json is accessible
- Ensure icons exist and are correct size
- Check browser console for errors

### Service Worker Not Registering
- Clear browser cache
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Verify sw.js is in public folder
- Check service worker scope

### Offline Mode Not Working
- Service worker must be active
- Check cache configuration
- Verify network requests are intercepted
- Test in private/incognito mode first
